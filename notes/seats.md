Thanks to [this listing](https://www.facilitron.com/facilities/f4560d17276224d5e1ad), I can have a detailed look at the layout of the seats.

The front three regions have 13 rows, generally with 14 seats each. However, the back 2 rows have 4 seats removed each in the middle (leaving five seats on either side) for wheelchair accessibility. The front two rows of the front middle region and the front-most row of the front side regions only have seven seats. Looking towards the stage, from left to right, the shorter rows are right-, centre-, and left-aligned (aligned towards the middle of the room).

In the back, the middle region is split in half with 6 seats on either side. The side regions have 14 seats in each row and at least 9 rows.
